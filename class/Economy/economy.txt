Economy Class

SriLankan Airlines Economy class is where intricacy meets simplicity; 
the perfect combination for an enjoyable flying experience. 
Adjustable seats, mouth-watering cuisine with a choice of up to 
three main courses (on long haul flights), light snacks, teas, coffee 
and complimentary bar service including a range of wines, spirits and 
soft drinks, and an inflight entertainment with over 100 movies to 
choose from for all ages - these are the little luxuries that make pleasant 
travel memories for everyone on-board.
